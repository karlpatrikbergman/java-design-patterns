Goal:
We need to be able to execute all Accounts methods, and take certain actions depending on the Exception that is
thrown. We don't want to repeat catch clauses in every method (withdraw, purchase, deposit etc)

Solution:
Put exception handling/mapping in abstract class AccountExecutor. Create anonymous classes that implements
AbstractExecutor.

In a real world example AccountClient would probably do more than just delegate to Account.
